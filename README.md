My name is Rishikesh, and I am a Junior at Caldwell for a Bachelor of Science (BS) in Computer Science and Mathematics. I love doing Deep RL, Backend, and Web3 Dev. I'm most passionate about the use of tech to solve problems that really matters (not leetcode ofc). I like to spend my free time reading and listening to podcasts, with some of my favorite topics being startups and AI.
