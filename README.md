Hi! I'm Aryan, a junior CS student at Cornell University.

I enjoy building web applications on all levels of the tech stack. I am very passionate about systems programming and cloud computing, and also occasionally dabble in machine learning.

On my Github, you can find some of my notable projects - two that I am particularly proud of are Distributed Database and Minimal Browser.

Do visit my blog if you are interested in these projects - I explore them and other interesting topics related to Systems Programming, Backend Web Development and Cloud Computing.

You can email me at yadavaryan424@gmail.com or ay394@cornell.edu.
